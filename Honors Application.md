### Introduction

Hello, I am Ethan Turkeltaub, and I am an introvert.

Being an introvert isn’t unusual, per se. In fact, 20% of us are. However, our society is geared far more towards extroverts.

I was an introvert in high school and will continue to be on into college. I am analytical. I cannot easily express my emotions. I do not go out of my way to be social with my peers. But, my solidarity has let me take a cursory look at my generation, and I’m not always enthused with what I see.

I recently read Susan Cain’s book _Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking_, and it was remarkable the potential benefits that introverts have in society, if only they weren’t held down.

Friends have remarked at my level-headedness, especially in tense situations. I provide a voice of reason — instead of leaping without looking, I look before I leap.

This is an unfortunately rare trait to find amount high schoolers, and especially college-aged students.

Literacy is seen as the foundation of civilization. Without written communication, what humans have built over the millennia is essentially worthless — history, philosophy, and languages are gone.

But what is overlooked is how that information is presented. Typography is perhaps just as important as the message that is being presented. Without characters and glyphs, an audience is restricted to those who can receive your message from spoken word.

In a documentary, I would present the viewer with a comprehensive overview of typography. The end goal would be to leave the audience with a new understanding and respect for the role typography and typographers play in society.

Typography began as handwriting in 3200 BCE Mesopotamia, and that is where the film would begin. Early Egyptian and Sumerian cuneiforms are starkly different from Chinese characters. Yet, remarkably, both civilizations developed these independently during the same time period.

As history progressed, so did the written word. The first complete text that was created with reusable characters dates between 1850 and 1600 BCE and was found in Crete, Greece. Multiple other uses of punches were used between the era of Greek civilization and the invention of the mechanical press in the mid-15th century.

The invention of the mechanical printing press with moveable type by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century is perhaps one of the most important moments in history. Having the ability to print multiple copies of a single manuscript with ease made possible the Reformation, Scientific Revolution, and several societal upheavals in the future.

Today, typography remains important — it is all around us. Street signs, advertisements, and literature are only a few examples of the boundless amounts of text we process each day.

The typographers and type designers of the world have an increasingly difficult job. Instead of just viewing type on a printed page, there are far more mediums in which type must be presented. Your phone, your computer, or your e-reader are all very different mediums with different jobs. A typographer must take into account what a user wants to get out of their use of each device, and must chose and position type accordingly.

The goal of the film is to give the audience a renewed understanding into the source and role of modern typography. The history of type is nearly as important as its use today. Showing how typography has shaped the lives of everyone is hopefully something everyone can relate to. The ubiquity of typography is another vital aspect to the film. Perhaps a good way to show this would be to briefly follow an ordinary person, highlighting every time that person reads a text, or looks at a sign, or types in a computer, and then showing what that person’s life would be like without the addition of typography.

Typography is an important part of society that does not get the respect it deserves. With this film, perhaps society would take a cursory look at the role and level of respect given to the typographer.
